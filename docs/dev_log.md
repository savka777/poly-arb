## [2026-02-21 00:00] Documentation Rewrite

### What Changed
- **Deleted:** `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`, `doc_logs.md`, `progress.txt`
- **Created:** `docs/dev_log.md` (this file), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/agents.md`, `docs/apis.md`, `docs/backlog.md`, `docs/uiux.md`
- **Rewritten:** `CLAUDE.md` — full hackathon pivot
- **Updated:** `.env.example` — removed Kalshi/risk vars, added `NEXT_PUBLIC_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, `EV_THRESHOLD`

### Decisions Made
- **Polymarket only** — dropped Kalshi to reduce surface area. One platform, one data wrapper.
- **Unified Next.js** — no separate Express backend. App Router API routes serve everything.
- **Single strategy (Event Pod)** — news-to-price lag detection only. Arb and time-series pods are post-hackathon.
- **In-memory store** — no SQLite for MVP. `Map<string, Signal>` is enough for a demo.
- **No risk manager** — no position sizing, drawdown, or concentration checks for MVP.
- **No virtual trading engine** — signals only, no paper trading.
- **3 sprints replace 6 phases** — hackathon-appropriate cadence.

### Now Unblocked
- Sprint 1: Foundation + Data + Agent (all P0 items through "agent produces valid Signal")

### Known Issues
- None yet — fresh start

### Next Up
- Initialize Next.js project
- Core types (`Result<T>`, `Market`, `Signal`)
- Polymarket data wrapper
- Valyu data wrapper
- Agent factory + event pod tools
